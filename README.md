# Lake-Temperature-Analysis
In this C program, real information about different temperatures of multiple lakes are read from a file. Then the information is processed into different categories and is displayed. 

The information is processed through the use of if-statements, methods and basic arithmetic calculations to determine average temperatures, maximum and minimum average lake temperatures, lakes above and below average, etc.
